# ImmutaProject Testing Framework
Objective
Current scope of the framework will be limited to the following:
 - test and validate the credentials for login - automation and manual approach
 - test and verify "Immuta’s global policy feature" - automation approach 
 - test and verify "Immuta’s search feature" - manual approach 
 
 In current project I used behavior driven development framework with Java, Selenium and Cucumber. 
 After testing is complete generate the report  and test details for verification.
